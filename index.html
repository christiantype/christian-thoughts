<h1>
    Hi, my name is Christian Solorzano
</h1>

<p class="large-p">
    … and I'm devoted to crafting human-centered experiences with an emphasis on interaction-design and collaboration.
<p class="large-p">
I currently reside in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago" target="_blank">Chicago</a>, where I create digital experiences at <a href="https://digital.pwc.com/en.html" target="_blank">PwC's Experience Center</a>. In the past I've worked for non-profits, educational institutions, and advertising agencies.
<p class="large-p">
    I enjoy writing, <a href="http://www.christiansolorzano.pictures/" target="_blank">photography</a>, and learning about new ideas.
</p>
<p class="large-p">
    My work is influenced by design history, advancements in technology and media, philosophy, and kindness.
</p>
<p class="large-p">
    I'm currently unavailable for work but you can look at my <a href="/files/solorzano_christian_resume_design.pdf">résumé</a> anyways.
</p>
