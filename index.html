<p class="large-p">
    Okay, my name is Christian Solorzano
</p>


<p class="large-p">
    I am devoted to human-centered design and experimental art-making.
<p class="large-p">
    Currently, I work at <a href="https://digital.pwc.com/en.html" target="_blank">PwC's Experience Center</a> where I concentrate on crafting digital experiences, through thoughtful strategy and execution. I'm passionate about mentorship and facilitating conversations, which is an essential part of my practice, and something I do through <a href="https://chicago.aiga.org/mentorship/mentor-program/" target="_blank">the AIGA Chicago Mentorship Program</a>.
</p>

<p class="large-p">
    My inspiration is found in writing, photography, my community, philosophy, history, diversity & inclusion, my design book club, and kindness.
</p>


<p class="large-p">
    I'm currently unavailable for work but open to collaboration/conversation.
