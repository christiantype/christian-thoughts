The Chicago Graphic Design Club's team, Jeffrey, Cheryl, Hamid, John, and myself â€” have a display at the Design 
Museum of Chicago. It is promoting our club AND our upcoming publication, Faculty. Go check it out! 

Special thanks to our friends Kevin and Tanner of the museum for offering the space and helping promote what we do. 
Much love.
