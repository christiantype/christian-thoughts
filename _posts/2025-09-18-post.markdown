I've been reflecting on our profession of design and concluding that what we do, is all alarmingly subjective. 
Thoughts on aesthetics and taste are all arbitrary—and what I may find as perfect, may make you yawn your face off.
This comes to mind after sharing work I found inspiring to a group of friends, and them all having a different 
opinion than mine — all which were valid and as true as mine. 

Taste—preferences—aesthetics—all that stuff means nothing.

What does matter is craft and attention-to-detail.
Everything after that—all subjective...
