I am working on an idea for a holiday card. The inspiration comes from meditation and the way the hands are 
suggested to be positioned when you meditate. Your thumbs lightly touching and hands fully rested as if you held a 
delicate flower between your palms. Often people think that when you meditate, you should not think or that your 
mind should be empty, however, whether that happens or not, is ultimately not up to you. 

The illustration of the 
hands come from the book Zen Training by Omori Sogen. Worth reading if you want a rigorous 
breakdown of what Zen truly means.
