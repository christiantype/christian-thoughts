Do you remember how exciting it was to collect CDs before streaming became the default listening experience? New 
cars do not even have CD players anymore. What about cassettes? Do you miss those?

What about those catalogs you would get in the mail where you could place an order for CDs that were too hard to 
find in your local record store? Small moments like this are surely missed. The listening experience today via 
mobile applications gives us the platform to explore new artists and music BUT there's nothing like putting a CD in 
your stereo and having *ONLY* those songs on your stereo to listen to, until of course, you put in a new CD. 

Good times...
