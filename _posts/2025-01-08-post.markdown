I haven't posted anything here in a long time... But I am still here doing things... 
A few projects are on the horizon, including the upcoming issue of Faculty magazine... Which I am anticipating to be 
a big enhanced version of the first issue... More pages... More vibrancy... More moreness... 

I am also taking a music class with Brian Eno and learning plenty of goodness there. 

Also happy new year...

Keep moving forward with passion and fury.
