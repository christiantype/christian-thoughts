Since I was a kid, I have always been fascinated by sound. Not just music but sound. I remember in the 1990s, my 
family had tape recorders in the house and I would record people's conversations and then play them back at various 
speeds and I was completely fascinated by how the pitch of somebody's voice would be something that I could play 
with. There isn't a day in my life that doesn't have some accompanying sonic backdrop. I tend to play the same songs 
over and over and over again — they become my friends and greatest inspiration. 

For the last four years, I have been creating music in my home studio and have released a few projects under various
pseudonyms and something I wanted to do in 2023, which I failed to do (within reason), was to release more 
under my name. But, as with any creative project, the small voice in the head will say things like “this isn't good 
enough. nobody will listen to this.” and frankly, the thing is, now I don't care.

Not caring is liberating and opens up the door for possibility. But, I am not saying that I don't wish my music to 
be enjoyable for others, because I do — I want people to like it, but that shouldn't be the metric for the success. 
The true metric of success (in my case), is personal satisfaction and creative growth — and most importantly practice.

So here is my first track, which I am releasing under my name, Solorzano. The track is an ode to one of my 
inspirations, Harold Budd, who passed away in 2020.
