There is great beauty to appreciate in the forgotten, abandoned, and overlooked. When I walk throughout Downtown 
Chicago, between the skyscrapers and modern architecture, there are pockets of magic in which the perfect scene 
presents itself to me. I love Chicago for this reason. There is beauty outside the conventional notions of *beauty*. 
And that is a fact. I am reminded of the philosophy or (way of seeing), called Wabi-Sabi which sees the beauty in 
imperfection, decay, and impermanence. It is about respecting all stages of change and honoring it for what it is.
