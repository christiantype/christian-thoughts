I keep a photo on my bookshelf of Booker T. Washington. Years ago, I read his autobiography, *Up From Slavery*. You can 
read his 
autobiography [here](https://docsouth.unc.edu/fpn/washington/washing.html). But, I suggest 
you pick up a printed copy instead. Reading on a screen sucks. :) I recommend that designers read this.
