description: "Christian Solorzano is a Chicago based designer who specializes in creating identities, design systems, interfaces, and thoughtful ideas for diverse audiences."

about: "How can we ensure that the experiences we are building are accommodating to a wide range of users? The Inclusive Design playbook highlights the benefits of adopting an inclusive collaborative framework across the design process. These findings and research came from extensive interviews with users and stakeholders. The objective is to design fully and intentionally and to consider the perspectives of people who experience the world differently. Currently, I'm developing an adoption strategy and developing interactive workshops that demonstrate its value and impact."
