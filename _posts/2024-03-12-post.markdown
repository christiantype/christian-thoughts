Don't you just hate it when you are writing something and then all of a sudden spellcheck comes along to correct you 
and tell you also that you need to rephrase what you just wrote... I am talking about Grammarly by the way. It is 
like you are saying something simple like, “Hey, I'm going to the store to get some pizza ingredients” and then all 
of a sudden everything is underlined in red. Okay, I gotta go.
