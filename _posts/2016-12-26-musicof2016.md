2016 was an exciting year for music. Spotify has transformed the way I consume music
I often fantasize about being an avid writer.

<i> “Today will be the day I write an amazing piece! I will share it with the world and all will great.”</i>

Life doesn't work that way. For the past couple of years, I've maneuvered between Wordpress and Tumblr. Which do I use? Which is better? Why do some people prefer one over the other? Does it matter? Ahh! At last I stumbled upon a static site generator called <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank">Jekyll</a>. It allows me to have total control over the layout of my journal.

So why keep a journal? Because, I enjoy writing, I want to improve my writing, I want to have an outlet on the web to share my thoughts, and because I enjoy it. Also, creating a blog through a static generator, opens the door for experimentation with web typography, which I absolutely love and obsess over.
