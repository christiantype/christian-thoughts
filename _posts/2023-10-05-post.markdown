The joy of building this website is relying on my own development and coding abilities. Everything you see here is 
built from scratch with the help of a few tools. They include: [Modular Scale](https://www.modularscale.com/) and 
[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).

I think of this portfolio as a sandbox to play with typography and the grid. Despite the *look* of this site being 
quite simple, the simple joys lie in the small details. There is great value in becoming familiar with the 
materiality of the web, 
for me, it helps me become more mindful of the way type and image sit on a grid and most importantly, help define 
my set of values in regard to layout and composition. Many of these things, I believe, are stripped away from us 
when we rely too 
heavily on 
templates and subject ourselves to the mercy of what they allow us to do.
