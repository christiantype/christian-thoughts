I have been reading [How To Cook Your Life](https://terebess.hu/zen/mesterek/cook.pdf
){:target="_blank"}, which is a book about the Zen Master Dogen's instructions, to the cook, also known as the Tenzo.
The role of the Tenzo is an important role, which is to nourish and plan the meals for the attendees and 
participants in a Zen monastery or retreat. They are responsible for preparing the meals, crafting the appropriate 
portions, and ensuring that everybody is fed. 

It is also a very honorable role, despite it being quite lonesome. You are required to wake up early to prep 
ingredients and spend the majority of your time in the kitchen. And just imagine, if somebody doesn' t like what you 
create, which often times are portions that are *just enough* and not always the most luxurious food. It can range 
from humble ingredients to very premium. So it is quite a duty. 

This book includes commentary on Zen Master Dogen‘s instructions to the cook (tenzo) — and highlights how our lives 
are very similar to that of the cook — we work with what we have in front of us. When we begin to discriminate and 
say one ingredient is better than another, we create duality that leads to suffering. So the teaching in this book 
is to dive deep into your work, regardless of what it entails. Do everything wholeheartedly. The good, the bad, the 
ugly, the beautiful — it is all part of the same meal.   

Here is a brief excerpt from the book.
