You know that feeling when you are on a website and you see an email or a contact link and you click on it and then 
all of a sudden your email client opens up on your computer... But it isn't the one you use, it's like Apple Mail. 
And as it is opening, you regret clicking on the link and wish you had just highlighted the email and copied and 
pasted it into your preferred email client... Well, that just happened to me and it sucks every time it happens.......
