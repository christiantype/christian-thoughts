I went to San Francisco this past weekend to see Daniel Lanois perform at Grace Cathedral. It was a concert and 
light spectable organized and hosted by [Reflections](https://ageofreflections.com/About){:target="_blank"}. 

During my trip, I did some sightseeing and here are some photos I would like to share with you.
