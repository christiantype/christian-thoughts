17 years ago, in 2007, in 7th grade I was tasked with completing a career assessment. I answered a series of 
questions and then I received a career recommendation based on my answers. My recommended career path was graphic 
design. Afterwards, I had to create a “career blueprint” of all the facets that there are in graphic design. I 
assume this activity was provided by the instructor to get the students to get into a mindset of *I know what I want 
to do after college*. Needless to say, here I am, in 2024 still doing graphic design and loving every minute of it. 
If there is one takeaway from this, it is to follow your dreams. I know it sounds damn cliché but like that blimp in 
Scarface says “the World is Yours”. 

Peace!
