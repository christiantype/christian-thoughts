A new song by Sparks... A lovely tune.

My devotion to you

Is ‘bout all that I do

Got your name written on my shoe

And I’m thinkin’ of gettin’ a tattoo

My devotion to you

Is ‘bout all that I do

Days I do not sing this song

You’ll still know my feeling’s strong


Everywhere we walk, though in a crowd, there’s no one else

Every Sunday morning I’m there praying for your health

Single-minded may be boring, most folks would agree

Though the word’s pretentious, I’d still call it destiny

My devotion to you

Is ‘bout all that I do

Got your name written on my shoe

And I’m thinkin’ of gettin’ a tattoo

My devotion to you

Is ‘bout all that I do

Days I do not sing this song

You’ll still know my feeling’s strong

You may be devoted to your country, God, or flag

Maybe you’ve a passion for a hobby or your Jag

Maybe you love work although I’m puzzled why you would

Maybe it’s your home team, someday, someday they’ll be good

Through all the years

Rent in arrears

You never cared

Can’t help but stare

You’ve never changed

Hair rearranged

That, though, is all

Time’s seemed to stall
