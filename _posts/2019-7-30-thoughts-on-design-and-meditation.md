<h2> Defining creativity </h2>
Creativity is perpetually defined but for the sake of this post, I will divide it into two basic categories. Creativity as art, such as paintings in a museum, that exist to inspire, inform, communicate, or a song that invites us to dance, think, or pray. And creativity that deals with problem-solving, like creating a form with buttons that accomodate color-blindness or a basketball player trying to score a point in a game of basketball. Whether you are taking a photo of a flower with your smartphone or blowing on your soup to cool it down, we perform creative rituals daily.

Meditation is concerned with emphasizing these rituals and unveils necessary information needed to investigate our own processes that help nurture creativity. This transparency I refer to as creative self-awareness, that sheds light on our individual existence and relationship with our surroundings.


<h2>Education beyond design</h2>
Design education focuses on studying the lives and work of graphic designers; Saul Bass, Massimo Vignelli, Beatrice Ward, etc. Students study the UPS and FedEx logos, and Paula Scher’s typographic masterpieces. Although this is advantageous and relevant to the creative field, design education lacks tribute to creatives outside the arts that specialize with the human condition—those that faced adversity and flexed their creativity to confront injustice and advocated for change. Historic figures like Frederick Douglass, Hellen Keller, Anne Frank, Marcus Aurelius, Buddha, Rosa Parks, etcetera, are not mentioned in design curriculums, yet these people are rich with information that is very much related to creative problem-solving. This is worth mentioning to illustrate that creativity is also found beyond design books, Instagram feeds, design publications, and more. Meditation is education an education.


<h2>Meditation and how it began for me</h2>
I’ve been practicing meditation for over two years now. David Lynch was the catalyst that peaked my interest after a wild spree of consuming his work. His method of transforming ordinary subject matter into something extraordinary inspired me and I became curious to know the source of this work. In his book, Catching the Big Fish, he mentions that inspiration comes from within—what this means is that, we, as humans, carry a vast endless ocean of creativity. Great ideas are fish living in this sea, and when we meditate, we can go deeper and deeper into this dark vast ocean and catch the big fish.

The life that we experience is housed within us and we project these experiences in the form of our behavior, actions, habits, and customs. Most of the time, we are unaware of our actions and we live blindly devoid of any meaning. This becomes dangerous when mixed with unhappiness and causes our creativity to halt. Meditation is being honest with ourselves and confronting life face-to-face and enabling us to translate our experiences in a positive way that nurtures creativity. This is a practice that has existed for thousands of years and if you want to learn more about the neuroscience behind it, I recommend reading this book: The Science of Enlightenment by Shinzin Young.


<h2>How it works</h2>
Within us, exists a stillness that is always present. To understand this stillness,  think of glimpses we experience at times of deep concentration, tranquility, peacefulness, and/or clarity. This is it, but without attachment, a state that is independent of external or internal circumstances. External referring to things that happen which we have no control over and internal referring to our emotions that tend to get in the way of seeing things at face value. Hectic lifestyles and a lack of self-maintenance force us to turn our backs to this pure state that we forget it exists. Meditation is this silent place that can prevent controlling nuisances from taking the wheel—it’s a retreat and a treat.


<h2>Clouds that look like animals and trees that are old and big</h2>
The senses have everything to do with creativity and tuning into our senses grants access to information in a clearer way. The weather in Chicago is extreme with brutal winters and summers. Days ago, the weather was smoldering and social media warned us of the dangers and residents posted their complaints about the heat. I began to feel nauseous driving in my car while refusing to turn on the A/C—I wanted to know what being hot truly feels like. I focused my attention to the sweat on my forehead, my glowing skin, open pores—it felt as if the sun was hugging me. This felt quite comforting and no longer hot because I was no longer identifying with the heat but observing. When we invite our senses to come together, we experience things more fully and can thus make more informed decisions. Our surroundings never stop moving, the world never stops turning—everything is always speaking to us. Let’s listen.


<h2>For everyone</h2>
Meditation is for you and then it is for others. Realize that you can mediate and it’s not something for people that have time. The perfect moment to moment to mediate will never arrive; to-do lists will always be full, we will always be busy, problems will always exist. If we realize that sitting still for a few minutes a day is uncomfortable, then we must sit. Only by confronting the uncertainty can we overcome it.

<h2> Resources </h2>
I am not here to teach you how to mediate but to encourage you to start and figure out what works for you. Here are some great resources I recommend. Meditation is merely the beginning of a long journey of self-discovery.
