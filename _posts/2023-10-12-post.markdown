Last week, the Chicago Graphic Design Club hosted a walking tour of Chicago through the lens of graphic design and 
the teachings of Sister Corita Kent. The walking tour was simple in its instructions but profound in its layered 
lens of seeing the City of Chicago anew through small viewfinders that my friend, collaborator, and 
facilitator of the 
event constructed. We met outside the Art Institute and walked down Michigan Avenue looking at the environment 
around us while paying close attention to architecture, nature, people, typography, and all the beauty around us 
that often goes unnoticed.   

Special thanks to my friend, brotha, and partner-in-crime John Hatherly for creating and leading this event.

See you later.............
