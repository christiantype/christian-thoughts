Almost twenty years ago, when I got my first camera. A small Sony point-and-shoot, I would publish photographs on 
Flickr. I still continue to do so (when I remember). Recently, I went on a photoshoot with my friend Nick Haas. I 
uploaded some of the photographs I took throughout downtown Chicago on my Flickr account, which you can access below... 

Enjoy.
