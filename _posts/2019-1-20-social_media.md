I grew up with social media. In the heyday of MySpace, I had a layout that complimented my aesthetic, personality, and chameleon-like identities. It was a time of self-discovery and growth. I was immersed in music and discovering the likes of Leonard Cohen, Bauhaus, Nick Cave, Brian Eno, and all the eccentric heroes whose work would become the pillars of my youth. Without this time, my career as a designer probably wouldn’t exist. Social media provided an outlet to experiment with graphic design. I still recall writing poetry and pairing it with visuals that complimented the words. The Internet was a young playground that existed in one location—at home. It was mounted on a desk and not portable. Yet, we got along just fine. Social media still exists but since its inception over a decade ago, it has drastically changed—and I absolutely despise what it has become.

<h1> Social media disrespects, alienates, & does not care about us.</h1>

MySpace disappeared and like most people, I flocked to Facebook. However, around Fall of 2017, my affinity and trust of Facebook started to grow weary. Slowly I began to disengage and in late 2017. I deactivated my Facebook only to continue activating it every few weeks to see if there was anything of importance to miss—this continued through 2018.

With Facebook out of the picture, I gravitated towards another popular platform called Instagram. Don’t get me wrong, Instagram is wonderful. It knows exactly what I like and it gives it to me. It knows that I love jiu-jitsu. It knows that I love wristwatches. It knows the films I watch. **It knows too much much about me.** This is exactly why in December of 2018 I quit Instagram. Soon I started to realize that too much of my time was spent consuming content and not enough time was spent creating content. I tried to write more, create more, work on my projects; yet I rarely did. Joining Instagram was never to share selfies or to flaunt my lifestyle. It was more of an avenue of expression. I see something I like, I capture it, and I share it. It was my brand of photography that encapsulated my visual philosophy.

Around my departure from Instagram I started asking myself these questions:

1. Why am I sharing this? Is this important to share?

2. How will sharing this make me feel, and why is it making me feel this way?

3. What gives me the right to subject people to this post?

I asked myself other questions too but mindfulness was key in assessing the quality of my posts: *but why the hell does it matter what other people think?* Well, isn't it social media? I think social media is anything but social.


<h1> The invasiveness of social media robs us of our attention with videos of friends shopping, eating, and sharing <em> ideal </em> lifestyles. </h1>


Looking back, I am embarrassed by some of the content I would share.

1. Post-workout photos of the gym; proving to people that I care about my physical health and obviously not about my mental health. Ha!

2. Architecture photos of my surroundings, showcasing to people that I live an urban life amidst skyscrapers.

3. Photos of food to flaunt my economic excess.

4. Artistic renditions of my surroundings aimed to appeal to the artsy f***ing community.

5. <em> Candid </em> fragments of my life in the best angles.

Social media teaches us to appreciate things at their cyber currency. Gross.


Inquisitive dialogues took place front-and-center and with with hope I clinged onto Instagram with hopes that I would magically one day arise and my relationship with the platform would improve. You see, everything that we engage with converts into a relationship. My relationship with social media was not mutual. Social media does not care if I am tired or if I am hungry. Social media does not care about my posture. Social media does not care about germs. Social media does not care about my real human relationships. Social media does not care if I promised myself to read more books. Social media does not care about the fragility of life. <b>It doesn’t care about any of that.</b> It craves my attention and will do whatever it takes to take it—and for a long time it succeeded.

Our morning ritual begins with our phone. It wakes us. It takes our photos. It reminds us. It’s an appendage to our body even though it is not attached. We put our trust into our device and believe that it will improve our life and that it will know what is best of us. We know it’s not perfect and we accept it either way.

We use social media to escape the silence that exists between moments. We trust it with our memories and store our most personal and intimate selves. The very fact that Social Media is hard to quit suggests that it’s an addiction. But I can quit if I want to. But you don’t. Social media has gripped us by our insecurities, fears, and weaknesses. It’s a landscape void reality and before we know it—it will become our reality. The dark patterns continue to feed and we continue to give.

The glimpses of our lives through Stories are mere fantasies that can never capture the raw beauty of our individuality. Feeds are nothing more than fractions of reality. The economy time is valuable and no

The paradox is that we know that Social Media is bad for our Mental Health yet we continue. Maybe one day I will return but as of right now there are too many other things to


At the end of the day, I don’t have sh!t to prove to anybody but those I work closely with and those I love. Everybody else can f*ck off.

it grips us with promises that dont compare w the severity of danger it causes
