title: "Faculty"
client: "Faculty, an online publication"
brief: "Faculty is an online publication created by me, Christian Solorzano, immediately after graduating from DePaul University in June, 2016. Faculty is updated periodically and plans to grow in 2017. "
research: "This project is an on-going research project that requires me to constantly be looking for inspiration in books, people, designers, environments, places, etc. I find the most valuable research in everyday life and daily observations which I am constantly writing about in my sketchbook."
solution: "At the moment, Faculty's website is a foundation with the intent to grow and develop into a community of creators with a deep passion for humanity's well-being. The design research involved observing other online publications and creating a cohesive online platform that is flexible and has the ability to house a vast amount of content in a efficient and user friendly way."
