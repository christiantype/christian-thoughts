Design, what happened?

You used to be dangerous.
You used to scare the shit out of people.

Then you forgot how to play.

You chose to stick with the straight lines and rounded corners. 

Polished and gleaming (your Swiss-clean typography, editing out the mess real life is).

You alone can shift the foundations of this stilled world. 

You can conjure new stories, new symbols, propose new aesthetics for the planetary drama we’re in.

You hold Prometheus’

holy fire in your hands.

Now use it!
