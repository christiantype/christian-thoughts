Spent the afternoon discussing the future of design competitions alongside two friends. Segura & Fermoyle. 
Asking big questions... Such as: What is good? Who is deemed worthy of judging something? What is judgement? Who 
judges? Why that person? What is criticism versus negativity? Who sets the standards? What does it mean to be chosen?
Many questions... To be continued. Inshallah...
