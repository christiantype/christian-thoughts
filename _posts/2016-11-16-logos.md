title: "Logos Various"
client: "Various"
brief: "When working on logo projects, I start by asking questions, listening, and taking good notes. "
research: "The research always involves dozens of sketches. I try to understand the language of the target audience and find a way to create something that resonates with them."
solution: "I believe simplicity is more effective than complexity. However, I still think that logos should have a strong platform and encompass propositional density."
