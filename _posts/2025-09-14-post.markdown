Today, I turn thirty-four years old.

I was born on this day, in Dallas Texas.

Being alive for this long, I arrive at a few key lessons learned along the way.

They are:

1. Be stubborn with your purpose
2. Take calculated risks
3. Embrace boredom
4. Don't pick sides (be in the middle)
5. It's possible to hold two opposing truths
6. Find mentor(s)
7. Love your enemy
8. Try not to use divisive language 
9. Embrace solitude
10. Give back
11. Every now and then, be a bit reckless
12. Listen more than you talk
13. Walk the middle way
