Today, I turn thirty-four years old.

I was born on this day, in Dallas Texas.

Being alive for this long, I arrive at a few key lessons learned along the way.

They are:

1. Be stubborn with your purpose
2. Take calculated risks
3. Embrace boredom
4. Don't pick sides (be in the middle)
5. Learn to sit with two opposing truths
6. Find mentor(s)
7. Try not to use divisive language 
8. Embrace solitude
9. Give back
10. Be a bit reckless occasionally
11. Listen more than you talk
12. Teach
13. Don't strive to always make sense
14. Move around (whatever that means)
15. Speak up
