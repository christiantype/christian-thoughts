client: "PwC Deals"

about: "PwC's Deals platform needs to achieve a 17% growth. Currently, the process is labor intensive and manual. New engagements are often created from scratch and a central hub of resources does not exist. The challenge was to provide a user experience that partners and staff can utilize to initiate new engagements and delegate tasks. This experience and concept is called Retina."

<h2>Partner receives new opportunity, delegates to Director. </h2>

The Partner contacts one of their Directors to take lead. The UI/UX uses progressive disclosure to emphasize one question at a time. </p>
