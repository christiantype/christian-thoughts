Looking back at all the accomplishments and things I consider worthwhile—they've all been pretty challenging and difficult. At the end however, they're incredibly rewarding the joy is irreplaceable. As I enter my first year as a college graduate, working full time as a graphic designer, I make sure to continue the curiosity and humility of a student. When possible, I seek out opportunities that are foreign to me and that will provide a challenge.

<h3>It's okay to say “I don't know”.</h3>
There's some schools of thoughts that emphasize, ‘faking it until you make it’ and although, I think this is a great approach, I think it's also okay to simply say <em>I don't know</em>. Personally, those three words signify that a) You are aware b) You are willing to <em>know</em>. Even though, I know this, sometimes it can be a big dissatisfying to admit my lack of knowledge.
