I'd like to share two pieces of music which have been on repeat lately, as the days get shorter in Chicago and trees 
turn bare. Both composed by prolific musicians, John Cage (1912–1992) and Pat Methany (B. 1954) with Lyle Mays (1953–2020).

Both sonic backdrops that carry a gentle presence, existing out of time. Worlds of their own. Desolate cover art. 
Sweet and poignant.
