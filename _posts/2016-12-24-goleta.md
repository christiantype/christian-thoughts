title: "Go Goleta"
client: "Go Goleta"
brief: "Go Goleta is the destination marketing organization that provides tourism services under the Goleta Valley Chamber of Commerce (Goleta Valley COC). Their mission now is to establish Goleta as its own destination brand via a new website which provides inspiration for the Go Goleta brand alongside a user-friendly experience that offers the necessary tools and information to ultimately drive bookings to Goleta."
research: "Communication with the client was a key component of this project. Throughout the research phase, we explored trends and design patterns within tourism websites. Our main focus was to make this website as user friendly as possible so we focused on balancing the visual components with the functionality of the website.  "
solution: "After months of revisions, concepts, and iterations, the client chose a direction. From there, we proceeded to create full web layouts for the entire website. The client is in charge of populating the website with content so creating a easy-to-navigate content management system required myself as the designer to think about how the content will exist within the website's back-end. Numerous assets had to be created for the website such as web-optimized images, icon library, detailed layouts for the developer, and much more. Go Goleta is set to launch in 2017."
