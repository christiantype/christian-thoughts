Looking back at all the accomplishments and things I consider worthwhileâ€”they've all been challenging and difficult. However, at the end, they're incredibly rewarding and the joy is irreplaceable. I welcome the new year with the curiosity and humility of a student. Never forgetting that hard work pays off and that it is our responsibility to do great work.

I've compiled a list of advice that I'd love to share with those who are entering the early stages of their career; those who find themselves facing difficulties and challenges. Keep in mind that you ought to enjoy the difficulties. Imagine that you're on a river and rather than fighting the current, I recommend that you go with the flow. It'll be fine. I promise.
