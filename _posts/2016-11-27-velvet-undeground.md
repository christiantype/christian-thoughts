title: "The Velvet Underground & Andy Warhol Story"
client: "Personal"
brief: "Create a print layout about Andy Warhol's involvement with the band the Velvet Underground and their collaboration."
research: "The research that helped drive the creativity behind this project was my familiarity with the Velvet Underground and Andy Warhol. I collected a variety of Andy Warhol images for reference, as well as searched for photos of the band that would help drive the narrative forward."
solution: "The visual solution ended with combining the aesthetic of both Warhol and the Velvet Underground. The color palette originated from Warhol's pop influence. The choice for using black and white photography was intended to create contrast with the story's cover image."
