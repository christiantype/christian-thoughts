For almost two years, I have been having conversations with designers and creatives on a whole range of topics. I am 
most interested in their process and understanding the intricacies of the qualities that move them to *create*. I 
admire people that *create* because I know that *creating* often 
requires rigorous discipline that is not always enjoyable. This discipline asks that you show up on both sunny and 
rainy days. But the lessons of breathing life into an idea and seeing it flourish — or wilt, are worth every moment.

But having an idea is easy. Seeing them through completion is the challenging part. And even more so, continuity and 
practice 
matters. This messy life of *creativity* and *wonder* often comes with accepting the dreadful reality that, and I 
quote designer, [Sean Fermoyle](https://seanfermoyle.com/){:target="_blank"} , *there
are more ideas than time*. 

But regardless, we wake up, we do our jobs, and if we are lucky, we are creatively fulfilled there — and when not, 
there presents the opportunity to seek new challenges and opportunities, through self-initiated projects or 
collaborations or research. 

In this arena of *graphic design* — this practice/discipline, comes with the necessity to be surveyors of the world. 
I recently spoke with the artist, [Benjamin Edgar](https://www.benjaminedgar.com/){:target="_blank"} , in which he described the creative process as a form of *walking 
meditation*, in which *we* 
form close relationships with the world around us, suspending our intellect and letting *intuition* lead the way. I 
couldn't agree more.
