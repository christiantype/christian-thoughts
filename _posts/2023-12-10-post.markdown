So you want to create a podcast episode? Here is a checklist.

- Have recording equipment. You can purchase an inexpensive microphone online or invest in a good one, like a Shure 
  SMB7, which is what many professionals use, like Joe Rogan and Ozzy Osbourne. 
- Find person to speak with. Do not be nervous or afraid. People are flattered when you ask them to be interviewed.
- Reach out to them expressing authentic interest and admiration for the work that they are doing. Send message in 
  an informal way. Do not pretend to be something you are not. Explain to them what your show is about. Present to 
  them a few ideas on topics you wish to cover. Provide them with some options of some dates that you can use to 
  record. 
- Once scheduled (via calendar), do your research. Create a discussion guideline of questions. Do 
  good research. Crawl the 
  internet.
  It's okay to be an “internet stalker” at this point. It's in the name of journalism. 
- On the day of recording, allow a few minutes to walk the interviewee through the logistics. Explain to them  how 
  the recording will work, when the episode will be released, ask if they have any questions for you. And then 
  record. Test your microphone and theirs. Ensure that the quality is good on both ends. (This is if you are 
  recording virtually)
- As you are recording, refrain from being nervous. Remember, that they are mere mortals. Sure, they are cool but 
  you being nervous will not help the situation. Be calm. Have green tea nearby. If possible, light an incense for 
  a chill *vibe*. 
- Once you are done recording, chill for a bit, thank them for their time. Then thank them again. Then thank them 
  again. And then thank them one last time. 
- Ask them for a headshot to use as the cover art for the episode. Also ask for any relevant links that they would 
  like you to share. They can email this to you. Make sure they send high-res images, so things look sleek and 
  *professional*.
- Now the fun part begins... Editing. This will take hours. You may need to create an intro and an outro, plus have 
  a theme song as well to kick off your episode(s). Make sure the volume/audio of the episode is fine. Edit, send 
  the episode to your phone, go on a walk and listen to with headphones. Make notes of any flaws or imperfections 
  that you want to edit and then go back and edit.
- Learn to love your voice.
- Once you are done editing and you have listened to the episode at least a million times, begin to create the 
  episode graphics. 
- Upload the podcast to the platform of your choice. I use “Podcasters by Spotify”. It is easy to use. 
- Craft your description of the episode. Make sure it is representative of the talking points in the conversation.
- Publish the episode to all the platforms like Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Stitcher, Amazon, etc.
- Now publish and share on social media. Make sure that you tag the guest and that you use the appropriate hashtags.

All of this will take at least 10 hours. But if you enjoy it, it is worth every second. Most importantly, make sure 
that 
as a 
podcast 
creator, you are taking care of yourself by exercising, taking breaks, drinking water, and resting your eyes. If you 
want to do this for a long time, you ought to take care of yourself. 

Also, in the beginning don't worry about listens or subscribers or any of that. It will take time to build a 
reputation and following. 

*The important thing is to be consistent and disciplined.*
