There exists a piece of music called ‘Spiegel im Spiegel’, which means Mirror in th Mirror in German. 
One of the most hauntingly beautiful sonic minutes to experience.
It was composed by Arvo Pärt (b.1935), an Estonian composer in 1978.

It pulls you in all directions — suspending you and gently letting you fall and just right before crashing below, 
you're suspended once more — airy, nostalgic, timeless — and on occasion, a forlorn BOOM!
