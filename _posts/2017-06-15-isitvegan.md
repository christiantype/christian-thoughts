title: "Is it Vegan?"
client: "Design Concept"
brief: "Is it Vegan? is a mobile application that allows user to scan products to determine whether said project is vegan or not. The application searches through an extensive database and is constantly being updated with new product codes. The design brief was to improve the user experience of the existing app with something more user-friendly and aesthetically pleasing."

research: "The objective was to clean up the application and get a better understanding of the information architecture and eliminate redundant or unnecessary options.  "


solution: "As with other apps I’ve redesigned, one of the main issues was gathering content and seeing how different personas would interact with the app. The design principles used are iconic representation when a product result is shown — in combination to an icon, color is also used . Proximity is seen on the homepage, both the scan and manual options are placed side by side as they are both the only two ways to use the app. Hierarchy and Legibility are present in the result page. Font-sizes differentiate the different levels of information. Larger font-size indicates heading — smaller font-size indicates body copy. Alignment is also integrated — items are aligned on a grid. On every page, visibility is implemented by the settings gear that is on the top right of every page. This feature needs to be present on every page as an escape and way to access the settings from every page. The settings feature allows users to toggle features and adjust the font-size."
