<ol>
<li>
<h4><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/331344.Being_Peace" target="_blank">Being Peace —  Thich Nhat Hanh</a></h4>
I find it necessary to remain grounded spiritually and mentally. It's easy to allow life to distract and take you away from our fundamental human purpose, which is to be kind, aware, present, and giving. This book helps put things in perspective and helps one realize that there's more to life than just <em>work and more work</em>.

<h4><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49552.The_Stranger">The Stranger — Albert Camus</a></h4>
This was an entertaining book that provided a unique perspective on an ordinary person that is presented with extraordinary circumstances. Plus, this book was the inspiration for one of my favorite songs by the Cure.
</li>
<li>
<h4><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7750136-design-and-truth">Design and Truth — Robert Grudin</a></h4>
A must read for designers. Design is everywhere and it should be honest.
</li>
<li>
<h4><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/90591.The_Favorite_Game">The Favorite Game — Leonard Cohen</a></h4>
Leonard Cohen has the gift of writing and this book is no exception. Cohen tells the story of loss, love, death, and Montreal Life. This book is an absolute gem that is nothing less than poetic.
</li>
<li>
<h4><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30659.Meditations">Meditations — Marcus Aurelius</a></h4>
A detailed insight into the mind of a philosopher trying to make sense of the world. A timeless classic.
</li>
<li>
<h4><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/629.Zen_and_the_Art_of_Motorcycle_Maintenance">Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance: An Inquiry Into Values — Robert M. Pirsig</a></h4>
A powerful and moving book that explores the philosophical value of life. I keep this book nearby just in case.
</li>
<li>
<h4><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/14828812-metaphysics">Metaphysics: A Very Short Introduction — Stephen Mumford</a></h4>
Ah, metaphysics. What does that word mean? I still don't know how to describe it but I know what it means. Better yet, I feel what it means. How can I know what something means? What do I know?
</li>
<li>
<h4><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27150875-the-politics-of-design">The Politics of Design: A (Not So) Global Manual for Visual Communication —  Ruben Pater</a></h4>
I've always felt somewhat morally responsible for what occurs in the world. Whether it's because I purchase certain products, consume certain things, or participate in certain activities. As a designer, I feel compelled to use my skills and talent to make this world a better place. The only way to do so is by expressing interest in current events and engaging in the things that matter. This book is a nice and brief introduction into the many ways that graphic design influences and shapes our planet.
