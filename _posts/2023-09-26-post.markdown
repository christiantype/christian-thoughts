I am thinking about what roles mean. Often, we get carried away with ways to define ourselves. Today, there are 
more and more ways to self-identify. But at the end of 
the 
day, identity is much more complex than roles, accolades, awards, recognition, titles, etc. Who we are goes beyond 
language and words. Language is limiting â€” it is a safety net at best. I think we should take our roles serious but 
not so serious to the point of rigidity and clout.
