I saw Morrissey at the Aragon Ballroom in Chicago. It was an excellent show. He is the greatest singer of our 
generation — an unapologetic voice — a real original. In an increasingly standardized cultural arena — Morrissey 
represents individuality and authentic vitality.

Notable tunes were Lost, All The Lazy Dykes, and Life is a Pigsty.

Super.

Here are some photos...
