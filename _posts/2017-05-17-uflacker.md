title: "Uflacker Academy"
client: "Uflacker Academy"
brief: "Uflacker Academy is a Brazilian Jiu Jitsu academy in Chicago. Their previous website was outdated, unresponsive, and inconsistent with current web trends. My task as the lead designer was to create a new custom interface dedicated to communicating the academy's philosophy, curriculum, and programs."
research: "Research comprised of understanding the client's needs and their problems with their old site. The new interface required user-friendly navigation with quick access to academy programs, class schedule, contact forms, and much more. The visual design of the website was inspired by the interior of the facility and traditional graphic design with an emphasis on white space, minimalism, and branding."
solution: "The finished website is a responsive experience built with the user experience as the most important element. The interface is devoted to form and function. "
