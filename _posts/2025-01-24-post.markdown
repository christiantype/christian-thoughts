I tend to be quite obsessive when it comes to things I like. My latest obsession has been the Penguin Cafe Orchestra. 
A music group which was founded in the mid 1970s by Simon Jeffes. After Simon died in the 1990s, the Penguin Cafe 
Orchestra became dormant only to later be revived by his son Arthur as the Penguin Cafe. This was in 2009. Their 
music opens up the door to happiness and creates an atmosphere that brings forth enthusiasm and a passion for life. 

Here are some of my favorite pieces of theirs.
