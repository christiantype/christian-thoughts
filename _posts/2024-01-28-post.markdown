I spoke with the designers [Larry](https://www.instagram.com/larrytchogninou/){:target="_blank"} and [James](https://www.instagram.com/jameslangfordd/){:target="_blank"} of the design 
practice, [Points of Sail](https://pointsofsail.net/){:target="_blank"}. Larry brought up the idea of the *3 Practices*, which is a way of operating as a 
designer/creative â€” these 3 practices are combined to be well-rounded and versatile. I am always looking for new ways of 
seeing the world and 
evolving the way I do things,
so his 
insight was helpful. 

This conversation will be released in the coming weeks through *Underscore*. 

Here are the *3 Practices*

### Solo
The work you do alone. This includes solo projects. Experiments. Self-intiated projects. Ideas. Concepts. Explorations. 

### Duo
Or group. The projects that you do in collaboration with others. This allows you to learn from others and exchange 
ideas.  

### Consulting
Sharing what you know with others. Giving back. Helping. Contributing to something that you believe in.

I can probably explain this better but I'm tired. Goodnight.
