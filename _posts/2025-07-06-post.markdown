We stand on the shoulders of giants

The least we can do is...

To go out and do better

Everything

Anything

There is a responsibility to be just

In all that we do

And to be bold

And unapologetic

Regardless of how

Stubborn

Or 

Confrontational

Or 

Difficult 

We may seem 

Because at the end

It's not about you or I

But about 

Us

Now Us

And 

Future

Us
